            <h2>Software Design & Engineering: Lessons from Android Event Tracking App</h2>
            <p><b>Artifact:</b> Event Tracking Android Mobile Application</p>
            <p><b>Created:</b> October 28, 2024</p>
            <p>
                This project allowed users to log in, create personal calendar events, and receive SMS notifications. 
                It was my first step into mobile development.
            </p>
            <p><b>Lessons Learned & Applied to iOS:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Gained experience with state management for handling user sessions.</li>
                <li>Learned best practices for secure authentication and user credentials.</li>
                <li>Developed event scheduling logic, which was later refined for iOS.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Impact on iOS App:</b></p>
            <p>
                These lessons helped me design a seamless event scanning experience in my iOS app. 
                I made sure that user events are structured properly and securely in their calendar.

            <h2>Algorithms & Data Structures: Lessons from Course Planner</h2>
            <p><b>Artifact:</b> Course Planner Application</p>
            <p><b>Created:</b> CS 300 Data Structures & Algorithms</p>
            <p>
                This project focused on searching, sorting, and organizing course data to help users find class requirements efficiently.
            </p>
            <p><b>Lessons Learned & Applied to iOS:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Improved understanding of sorting algorithms for event management.</li>
                <li>Learned efficient data searching techniques that made it into my iOS app.</li>
                <li>Applied best practices for handling structured input data.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Impact on iOS App:</b></p>
            <p>
                I applied these concepts by allowing users to filter and search through scanned schedules, making 
                event retrieval more efficient.

            <h2>Database Management: Lessons from Android Event Tracking App</h2>
            <p><b>Artifact:</b> Event Tracking Android Mobile App</p>
            <p><b>Created:</b> CS 360 Mobile Architecture & Programming</p>
            <p>
                This project involved user account management and event storage, teaching me critical lessons in 
                database security and data persistence.
            </p>
            <p><b>Lessons Learned & Applied to iOS:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Explored database trade-offs between Firebase, SQL, and local storage.</li>
                <li>Learned when to use UserDefaults for lightweight storage.</li>
                <li>Understood data security concerns and how to mitigate them.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Impact on iOS App:</b></p>
            <p>
                These lessons led me to use UserDefaults in my iOS app for quick data retrieval, while 
                considering Firebase for potential scalability.

            <h2>Final Thoughts: How These Lessons Enhanced My iOS App</h2>
            <p>
                I was able to avoid easy mistakes from previous projects. From database choices to state management techniques, everything I learned 
                contributed to making my iOS app a better product. Lots of research and development was needed to learn the IOS platform and the swift language. 
                Most of my reading was done from the documentation page on swift from apples website.
