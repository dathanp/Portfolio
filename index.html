      <h2>Portfolio</h2>
      <p> 
        Throughout my coursework in the Computer Science Bachelors program, I developed a strong foundation in software development, data structures, algorithms, databases, and security. Building my portfolio has let me reflect 
        on my work, highlight my strengths, and aligned my goals with industry standards. Gaining experience and refining
        my technical skills, collaboration, communication, and problem-solving skills has reshaped the way I work in the field of computer science.
        Working on team-based projects in my Collaboration and Team Project class helped me develop critical collaboration skills that showed me
        what it feels like to work with other developers and the processes they take to achieve goals. 
       </p> 
       <p>
        I used this knowledge in my internship program at Cooledtured.com 
        so that the web development team can help update, refine, and improve their website. I helped create their Bread Crumb Navigation, Product Pagination, and their careers page. I communicated with
        management about progress of work, cross collaborated with other lines of businesses to achieve business goals. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Building Bread Crumb Navigation was a challenge, I needed to test my data, develop an algorithm to sort the products,
        categorize them, and finally put it all in a map so that it can be displayed easily to the user for simple navigation through their website. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Creating Pagination was another challenge that I was excited to solve. This involved working with GraphQL and the ShopifyAPI. 
        </p>
        <p>
        In my Software Security class, I created SHA 256 authentication so that verified users can sign in with an API I developed.
        </p>
